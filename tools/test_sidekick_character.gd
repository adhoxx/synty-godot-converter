## Exercises SidekickCharacter against the real converted library.
##
## Run: godot --headless --path <output root> --script res://test_sidekick_character.gd
##
## The palette check is the important one: it samples every worn part's UV
## texels against the baked palette and fails on a pure red one, which is
## Synty's "this colour slot is undefined" sentinel showing through. That is the
## exact failure the shared library exists to prevent, across the whole wardrobe
## rather than the one character someone happened to look at.

## Preloaded rather than referenced by class_name: a --script run does not
## rescan the project, so the global class list may not yet know the type.
