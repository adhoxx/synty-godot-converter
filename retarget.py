"""Retarget Synty rigs onto SkeletonProfileHumanoid at import time.

A clip poses only the rig whose rest orientations it was authored against:
almost every track is an absolute local rotation, not a delta from rest. Synty's
character rigs and clip rigs disagree - measured on Dark Fantasy, the character's
`Spine` rest runs along X at (0.1039, 0, 0) and the clip rig's along Y at
(0.0005, 0.1039, 0.0030), orthogonal at identical magnitude - so binding one to
the other collapses the character rather than merely mis-posing it.

Godot's scene importer can rewrite both onto a common profile, given a `BoneMap`.
This module builds that map from a file's real bones and puts it where the
importer will read it.
