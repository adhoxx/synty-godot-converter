"""Sidekick character recipes.

Synty's SIDEKICK packs are a modular character creator rather than a set of
finished characters. A character is not one FBX: it is a recipe naming one part
mesh per body slot - head, torso, each limb, each armour attachment - with every
part skinned to the same 88-bone rig.

That recipe ships with the pack as a plain-text ``.sk`` file. The character's
prefab is no use to us: its SkinnedMeshRenderer points at a mesh Unity baked at
author time (``FantasyKnights_01.asset``), which Godot cannot import. The recipe
plus the part FBX is the only route to rebuilding the character, and both ship.
